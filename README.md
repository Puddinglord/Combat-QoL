# Combat-QoL
Makes running combat easier and more automated letting you focus on telling your story instead of the tokens.

Please note. I developed this with PF2e in mind. I will be working on making it system agnostic in a future update.

This module has the following features:
* Forces the selection of the attacking token and targeting the token you wish to attack.
  * I use a lot of automation in my games and I **need** my players to target what they want to attack. When they forget it's a small hastle on my end to manually check the attack against the AC of the monster and then apply the damage. This will pop up an error if one of the conditions aren't met and will not produce any roll. Currently this only works for attacks labeled with the `attack-roll` label. 
* Automatically removes all targets at the end of each turn.
  * This helps clean up each turn so you can start fresh! Now you never have to remind yourself or your players to clear their targets again!
